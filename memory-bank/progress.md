  - Search result optimization
  - Search analytics and insights
  
- **Content Management**: MEDIUM - CMS integration
  - Decap CMS setup and configuration
  - Content workflow optimization
  - Editorial interface for non-technical users
  
- **Analytics Integration**: MEDIUM - User behavior tracking
  - Vercel Analytics setup
  - Google Analytics 4 configuration
  - Performance monitoring dashboard
  
- **Advanced SEO**: MEDIUM - Enhanced search optimization
  - Schema.org structured data
  - Open Graph optimization
  - Twitter Card integration
  - Meta tag automation
  
- **Content Migration**: LOW - Existing content organization
  - Move existing posts to language-specific directories
  - Update frontmatter for new structure
  - Validate all content links and references
  
- **Performance Monitoring**: LOW - Advanced monitoring
  - Lighthouse CI baseline establishment
  - Core Web Vitals tracking
  - Performance regression alerts

## Known Issues
- **Language Structure**: MEDIUM - Current content not organized for i18n
  - Current content in root directories needs reorganization
  - No language detection or switching mechanism
  - Mixed language content in single files
  
- **Build Dependencies**: LOW - Node version warnings resolved
  - Upgraded from Node 16 to Node 18 successfully
  - All package compatibility issues resolved
  
- **Template Consistency**: LOW - Some template variations

## Development Metrics
- **Build Time**: ~4 seconds (excellent)
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with compression
- **Test Coverage**: Basic framework tests (4/4 passing)
- **Lighthouse Scores**: Baseline to be established
- **Page Load Speed**: Target <3 seconds (to be measured)

## Technical Debt Register
1. **Internationalization Architecture**: Need comprehensive i18n implementation
2. **Content Organization**: Restructure for multi-language support
